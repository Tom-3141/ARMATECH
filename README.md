# ARMATECH Collaborative CAD Design Repository

## Purpose

This repository enables multiple users to access a base CAD model, create their own versions, and share them with the community. Everyone can view and learn from each other's design approaches.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Fork** the repository.
2. **Copy** the file(s) from `/main-design/` into your own folder under `/designs/{your-username}/`.
3. **Edit** and save your versions.
4. **Push** your changes and open a Pull Request if you want to share your design.
5. **Browse** the `/designs/` folder to see others’ work.

## Guidelines

- Use Git LFS for all CAD files (see `.gitattributes`).
- Name your files and folders clearly.
- Respect others' work—do not overwrite or delete without permission.
- Add screenshots or documentation in the `/docs/` folder if desired.
